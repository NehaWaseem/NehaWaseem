Greetings , Iâ€™m Neha Waseem ðŸ‘‹ 

As an aspiring software engineer and a CS Junior, I am keen towards creating user-focused digital experiences and have been working upon Android application development with a focus on performance, usability and clean project architecture. My interest in forming dynamic and interactive web pages , has also enabled me to develop web applications using MERN stack for my semester projects. As they say , a creative design is as crucial as a clean code , my passion for crafting UI with strong visual structures and seamless user experiences has motivated me to learn UI/UX designing and expand my skill set.
